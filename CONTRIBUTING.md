# Contributing to Our Project
Thank you for your interest in ABAP file formats! We welcome contributions in all forms.

Here are some of the ways you can contribute to the repository/project.

Note: This is a living document. Like the code, this document will be improved over time with the help of our community. Feedback welcome.

## Reporting Issues
Bug reports welcome! We are using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/SAP/abap-file-formats/issues) for tracking bugs and other issues.

### Determining if an Issue Should be Created
Analyzing reports is a bit of work, so please ask yourself these questions before creating an issue:

* Does the bug really apply to the project?
* Has this bug already been reported?

### Providing the Right Information for the Issue
Summarize the issue well. Here are some guidelines:

* Provide detailed, step-by-step instructions for reproducing the issue with an example, including, if possible:
  * A URL to your example
  * Screenshots if it helps us understand better.
* Please report issues in English.

### Issue Reporting Disclaimer
Feedback, especially bug reports, is always welcome. However, our capacity as a team is limited -- we cannot answer specific project or consultation requests, nor can we invest time in fleshing out what might be a bug. Because of this, we reserve the right to close or not process issue reports that do not contain enough information. We also do not guarantee that every well-documented issue will be fixed.

## Contributing Code
We welcome contributions to our codebase.

Before you start your first contribution, please refer to [the contribution guidelines for SAP open source projects](https://github.com/SAP/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)
Due to legal reasons, contributors will be asked to accept a DCO before they submit the first pull request to this projects, this happens in an automated fashion during the submission process. SAP uses [the standard DCO text of the Linux Foundation](https://developercertificate.org/).
