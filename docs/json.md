## JSON Type Specification

* [Type Specification Example](#Type-Specification-Example)
* [Reusable Fields in JSON Files](#Reusable-Fields-in-JSON-Files)


Each JSON schema provided in this repository is automatically generated. For this purpose, an interface corresponds to each object type in which the necessary components of the type are described in the type `ty_main`. The name of the interface follows the pattern `zif_aff_<object_type>_v<version_number>`. `<object_type>` can be either the (R3TR) object type or the (LIMU) sub object type, since R3TR and LIMU object types share the same namespace. `<version_number>` is an increasing integer which starts with `1`.

The ABAP types are self-contained, so it is possible to work on them in any system (e.g., in an SAP BTP, ABAP environment system).

The JSON schema is generated based on the fields and their ABAP type specification defined in `ty_main`. Each field defined in the structure is transformed to a JSON representation using a camel case notation (e.g, field `abap_language_version` is transformed to the field `abapLanguageVersion` in the JSON schema). The ABAP type information fills the JSON schema fields `type`, `length`, `minimum`, `maximum`.

One mandatory component of the type is the field `schema` which is translated to `$schema` in the JSON schema.
Its value in the `.json` files is the link given in the field `$id` of the JSON schema.
Furthermore, a `header` has to be supplied.
The interface [`zif_aff_types_v1`](../file-formats/zif_aff_types_v1.intf.abap) offers different headers for reuse, but also other often repeated types.

In order to add more information to the JSON schema than that provided by the ABAP type, ABAP Doc can be used.
The comments are placed directly above the components of the type `ty_main`, but they are also read over several levels as, e.g., in the case of nested structures.
The different possibilities are summarized in the following.

### Title
To provide a title, an ABAP Doc shorttext
```abap
"! <p class="shorttext">Insert Title</p>
```
is used.
If no title is specified, the component name transformed to camel case is written.

### Description
An ABAP Doc comment without annotations is passed as description to the JSON schema.
```abap
"! This is the description
```
If no description is given, either the title, if provided, or the component name transformed to camel case is shown in the JSON schema.

### Enum Values
To pass enum values to a JSON schema, a type and a constant are necessary.
The type specifies the underlying data type and links to the constant via the following annotation:
```abap
"! $values {@link source_name.data:constant_name}
```
The names of the components of the constant are written as external (JSON) values to the JSON schema after being transformed to camel case (e.g, component `badi_definition` is transformed to the enum value `badiDefinition` in the JSON schema).
The corresponding values of the components represent the internal (ABAP) values.
Titles and descriptions of the enum values are passed to the schema in the same way as described above.
They are written in the fields `enumTitles` and `enumDescriptions`.

### Extreme Values
For numerical types, (exclusive) minimum and (exclusive) maximum values can be specified via the annotational keywords
```abap
"! $minimum value
"! $exclusiveMinimum value
"! $maximum value
"! $exclusiveMaximum value
```
followed by a space and the desired value.

### Length Specification
Choosing an ABAP data type with length specification results in the field `maxLength` being written. In order to do this including ABAP types whose length is not already set or to specify a minimum length, the annotations
```abap
"! $maxLength value
"! $minLength value
```
followed by a space and the desired value are used.

### Multiple Of
The annotation
```abap
"! $multipleOf value
```
ensures that values of a component described by this ABAP Doc comment can only be a multiple of the provided value.

### Required Fields
If a field is to be declared as "required" in the JSON schema, the annotation
```abap
"! $required
```
is used.

### Always Shown Fields
Normally, if an ABAP object is serialized, only the components of the corresponding type with a non-initial value are written to the `.json` file. If a component shall be shown regardless to its value, the annotation
```abap
"! $showAlways
```
is added. Note that also the `$required` annotation leads to such a behavior.

### Default Values
To ensure that only components whose value is not equal to a specific default value are written to the schema, the annotation
```abap
"! $default
```
 is used, followed by the specification of the default. To provide the default, there are two different possibilities:
1. If the component has enum values, the default value is specified by a link to the corresponding component of the constant describing the enum.
```abap
"! $default {@link source_name.data:constant_name.default_component}
```
2. In all other cases, the default value is given, surrounded by single quotation marks.
```abap
"! $default 'value'
```
Note that if you specify a default value, the initial values are written to the JSON schema, unless they are not equal to the selected default.

The order of these comments is important: First, there is the comment for the title followed by the one for the description, in case they are both provided. After these two, the remaining annotations are always located. Between them, the order is irrelevant.

### Additional Properties

Generated JSON schemas do not contain the property `additionalProperties`. This means, additional properties are allowed in the JSON files.
We want to support additional properties to be able to evolve the ABAP file formats in a compatible way. This allows us adding or removing non-mandatory fields in the future.

Adding additional custom fields any ABAP file formats JSON file is not allowed.


## Type Specification Example
Here is the shortened type used to generate the JSON schema for interfaces. It can be found in the interface [`zif_aff_intf_v1`](../file-formats/intf/type/zif_aff_intf_v1.intf.abap).
```abap
  TYPES:
    "! <p class="shorttext">Interface Properties</p>
    "! Interface properties
    BEGIN OF ty_main,
      "! <p class="shorttext">Schema</p>
      "! Format version
      "! $required
      schema     TYPE string,
      "! <p class="shorttext">Header</p>
      "! Header
      "! $required
      header     TYPE zif_aff_types_v1=>ty_header_60_src,
      "! <p class="shorttext">Proxy Interface</p>
      "! Interface is a proxy interface
      proxy      TYPE abap_bool.
    END OF ty_main.
```
With the specification of the component `header` and its used types in the interface [`zif_aff_types_v1`](../file-formats/zif_aff_types_v1.intf.abap)
```abap
  "! $values {@link zif_aff_types_v1.data:co_abap_language_version_src}
  "! $default {@link zif_aff_types_v1.data:co_abap_language_version_src.standard}
  TYPES ty_abap_language_version_src TYPE c LENGTH 1.

  CONSTANTS:
    "! <p class="shorttext">ABAP Language Version (Source Code Objects)</p>
    "! ABAP language version for source code objects. For non-source-code objects use
    "! {@link zif_aff_types_v1.data:ty_abap_language_version }
    BEGIN OF co_abap_language_version_src,
      "! <p class="shorttext">Standard</p>
      "! Standard
      standard          TYPE ty_abap_language_version_src VALUE 'X',
      "! <p class="shorttext">ABAP for Key Users</p>
      "! ABAP for key user extensibility
      key_user          TYPE ty_abap_language_version_src VALUE '2',
      "! <p class="shorttext">ABAP Cloud Development</p>
      "! ABAP cloud development
      cloud_development TYPE ty_abap_language_version_src VALUE '5',
    END OF co_abap_language_version_src.

  "! <p class="shorttext">Description</p>
  "! Description with 60 characters
  TYPES ty_description_60 TYPE c LENGTH 60.

  TYPES:
    "! <p class="shorttext">Header for Source Code Objects</p>
    "! The header for an ABAP main object (with source code) with a description of 60 characters
    BEGIN OF ty_header_60_src,
      "! <p class="shorttext">Description</p>
      "! Description of the ABAP object
      "! $required
      description           TYPE ty_description_60,
      "! <p class="shorttext">Original Language</p>
      "! Original language of the ABAP object
      "! $required
      original_language     TYPE sy-langu,
      "! <p class="shorttext">ABAP Language Version (source code object)</p>
      "! ABAP language version for source code objects
      abap_language_version TYPE ty_abap_language_version_src,
    END OF ty_header_60_src.
```
This leads to the following generated JSON schema:
```json

```
## Reusable Fields in JSON Files

This section describes fields that can be reused by all file formats.

The types for these reusables are defined in the interface [`ZIF_AFF_TYPES_V1`](../file-formats/zif_aff_types_v1.intf.abap).

### Schema

The field `$schema` is a meta field and defines the format and the format version of the JSON content.
Basically, it is needed to allow the incompatible evolution of a content type.

The field `$schema` specifies the location of the JSON schema with an URI.
As of now, this is a link within this repository.

---
**Note**: Versioning is not finally decided. Please refer to issue [#53](https://github.com/SAP/abap-file-formats/issues/53).

---

### Description

The field `description` contains the description of the object.

### Original Language

The field `originalLanguage` stores the information about the original language of the object.

The original language is specified with [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) language codes.

---
**Note**: It has to be decided whether the language code is specified in upper case (like in ABAP) or lower case as in the ISO 639-1 specification.
Refer to issue [#34](https://github.com/SAP/abap-file-formats/issues/53).

---

All translatable texts in the object shall be maintained in their original language.
Translations of the texts shall be stored in separate files.

The original language is not specified for sub objects. Sub objects have the same original version as their main objects.

### ABAP Language Version

The field `abapLanguageVersion` specifies the ABAP language version of an object.


With the ABAP language version, it is possible to specify which ABAP language elements and which other objects you can use in your object.
It does not specify the compatibility with a specific release (like SAP_BASIS 7.55).
The ABAP language version `standard` specifies no limitation with regards to the usage of ABAP language elements or other objects.
The ABAP language versions `cloudDevelopment` and `keyUser` are a subset of the ABAP language version `standard` and you can use only a subset of ABAP language elements and released objects.
For more details, you can refer to the [ABAP keyword documentation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm).

The field `abapLanguageVersion` is optional. Allowed values are `standard`, `cloudDevelopment` or `keyUser`. The default value is `standard`.

Implementations of ABAP file formats can decide whether they serialize the ABAP language version.

During deserialization, ABAP systems might change the ABAP language version needed in the specific context.
E.g., SAP BTP, ABAP environment systems set the ABAP language version to `cloudDevelopment`, while systems which do not support the ABAP language version might set it to `standard`.
